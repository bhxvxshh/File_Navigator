# File_Navigator
A Python script for finding, suggesting, and navigating files in specified folders or network drives. This tool helps users locate files by suggesting similar file names when the exact name is unknown. It also provides interactive folder navigation and lets users open files directly.

Features:

Finds files with similar names to what the user searches for.
Offers suggestions for close matches and allows users to select the correct file.
Supports interactive navigation through folders and lets users open files or folders directly.
Cross-platform support for opening files (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Tech Stack: Python (using standard libraries: os, difflib, and platform)

Usage: Simply run the script, type in the desired file name, and follow the prompts to navigate folders or open files.

Notes:
- This script is particularly useful for network drives, where file names might not always be remembered accurately.
- You can adjust the  cutoff  value in  find_similar_files  for more strict or lenient matching.
